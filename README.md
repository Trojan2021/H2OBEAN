For HackOHI/O 2023, we created a water quality tester and associated web app for mapping data. We achieve this by measuring the Total dissolved solids (TDS) in water. These are organic and inorganic materials, such as metals, minerals, salts, and ions dissolved in water. Our sensor runs on a ESP32-S3 that is powered by a lithium-ion battery. Using a TDS sensor, we can measure the conductivity of the solution and estimates the TDS from that reading.

The app can provide the community with up-to-date, real-time information about the quality of water in various locations. This information can include data on parameters such as pH levels, temperature, turbidity, and more. Having access to this information empowers individuals and communities to make informed decisions about water use, such as for drinking, swimming, or fishing. By crowdsourcing water quality data, the app can raise awareness about local water This, in turn, can lead to increased community engagement in environmental protection efforts. Users can quickly identify pollution or contamination issues, helping to address them promptly and prevent further degradation of water sources. The app fosters a sense of community collaboration. Users can work together to collect data, identify water quality issues, and advocate for necessary changes or improvements.
